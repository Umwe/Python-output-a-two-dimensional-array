# Python-output-a-two-dimensional-array

Let's output a two-dimensional array using a double loop


i have initialize a 2D array called months with 4 sublists to store the months of the year
then as the instruction said it must have double loop i used row and col variables for iteration of
elements within the list then used while loop is incrementing 

There is a conditional check to see if col has exceeded or is = to the length of the current row in the months list. If it has, it means we've reached the end of that row, so col is reset to 0, and row is incremented by 1, effectively moving to the element of the list

The loop continues, printing the names of the months one by one until it has iterated through all the elements in the 2D list.
